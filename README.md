# docker-image-hello-go

This repo was created for a class challenge from CodeEducation micro services course. I should create a docker image with size lower than 2MB.
When we run this image, it should print `Code.education Rocks!` on screen, using [Go](https://golang.org/).

To run it:

```sh
docker run felipebergamin/codeeducation
```
